# housing_managment
The main objective of this project is to manage the operations and activities of apartments. This is a simple user interface and  a web application which uses database to store all the data related to the customer ,flats etc and  their maintenance related information .
As the Owner of the flat system (user), would like to have an open website for all the my clients to go through the availability for occupied and unoccupied houses in the campus and list them , and collect peopleâ€™s details for further marketing purposes.As a Manager I would like to have the website 2 divisions where one side the customer can look for houses and in one side the occupants can check their monthly maintenance balance. Also, if the apartment is sold to some other customer, then these details are updated in the occupied list.
